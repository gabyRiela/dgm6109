        <h1 style="text-align:center">Plot 1: How is my morning energy affected by my workout over the course of the
            weeks?</h1>
        <p style="text-align: left"> <strong>Hypothesis:</strong> As time progresses through my workout routine
            (chronologically), my morning energy levels show patterns that predict my end of day outcomes. In addition,
            the energy change from after the workout to the end of the day might reveal whether workouts provide lasting
            benefits or temporary boosts, and higher workout intensity (measured by active kilocalories) might correlate
            with my ability to maintain morning energy levels throughout the day.

        <h3>Why this is one of my best scatterplots:</h3>
        <p>
            This visualization tells a unique story by focusing on <strong>morning energy</strong> as the Y-axis rather
            than end of day outcomes. This shift reveals whether I tend to start workouts feeling exhausted or
            energized, and how that changes over time as my body adapts to regular exercise. The color gradient (red =
            energy dropped after workout, blue = energy increased) immediately shows which workouts provided lasting
            energy versus those that left me drained by day's end. Circle size represents workout intensity, allowing me
            to see if harder workouts (larger circles) cluster at certain morning energy levels.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Technical implementation:</strong> I used Array.sort() to organize workouts
            chronologically by converting date strings to Date objects, which was essential for showing temporal
            progression. The calculateEnergyChange() function computes the difference between post-workout
            and end of day energy, revealing whether the initial boost from exercise lasts or fades. Using
            d3.min() and d3.max() made my circle size scale dynamic - it automatically adjusts
            to my actual calorie range rather than using hard-coded values. This plot answers: "Do I start workouts more
            energized as I build consistency, and do those workouts sustain my energy all day?"
