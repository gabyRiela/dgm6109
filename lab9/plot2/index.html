        <h1 style="text-align:center">Plot 2: How does my workout intensity vary over time?</h1>
        <p style="text-align: left"><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> How does the intensity of my training (measured in
            active kilocalories burned) vary over time, and what patterns emerge when analyzing post-workout energy and
            cardiovascular exertion? Furthermore, maximum heart rate could reveal which workouts truly test my
            cardiovascular system, regardless of calorie burn, and how this affects my energy levels.
        </p>
        <h3>Why this is one of my best scatterplots:</h3>
        <p>
            This visualization provides a crucial time series analysis of my workout output and recovery. By
            plotting Date chronologically on the X-axis and Active Kilocalories on the Y-axis, I can instantly
            identify trends in my sustained effort over time: Am I consistently challenging myself? Do I have
            high-calorie and low-calorie workout cycles?
        </p>
        <p>
            The combination of Maximum Heart Rate (Size) and Energy Level After Workout (Color) reveals the true
            physiological cost of my training. For instance, a small, dark red circle (low Kcal, high HR, low energy)
            indicates a short, punishing workout, while a high-Kcal circle with a light green color (high Kcal, good
            energy) suggests a highly effective and well-recovered session. This plot answers: "How does my training
            intensity (HR) and immediate recovery (Energy After) impact my calorie burn over the six-week period?"
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Technical implementation:</strong> The use of Array.sort() was critical here to ensure
            chronological order by converting date strings to JavaScript Date objects. Without proper sorting, the
            temporal story would be lost. Using d3.min() and d3.max() for all three scales Y-axis, and
            (size) makes this visualization fully dynamic, ensuring everything adjusts automatically when new data is
            added.
