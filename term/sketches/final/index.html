                <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
                <p>
                    As Active Kilocalories (Y-Axis) increase on any given day, the Energy Change (Shape) will more
                    frequently show a negative result (downward-pointing triangle). In addition, longer workout Duration
                    (Size) and high Maximum Heart Rate (color) might amplify the overall effort, leading to loss of
                    Energy. </p>

                <h3>Sketch Description</h3>
                <p>
                    A time series scatterplot with Date/Day on the X-Axis and Active Kilocalories on the Y-Axis.
                    Each point's size represents the workout Duration and its color represents the Max
                    Heart Rate (MaxHR). The shape is used to show the net change in energy: a triangle if
                    the energy went up, a downward-pointing triangle if it went down, and a circle. This
                    allows observation of high-intensity clusters over time and
                    their correlation with the change of energy.

                </ul>

                <h3>Justification</h3>
                <p>
                    This proposal is designed to check for sequential patterns and cumulative effects. By using
                    Date on the X-Axis, we can see if a string of high-intensity workouts (high Y-values, large
                    size, hot color) immediately precedes a day where the energy level shape (Glyph) change after the
                    workout.
                    The use of Shape for the change of Energy Level provides a clear, categorical distinction of the
                    primary
                    result.

                <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
                <p>
                    As the Intensity Workout (X-Axis) increases from Low to High, the median Energy Change (Y-Axis) will
                    decrease, In addition, the Duration (Size) and Maximum Heart Rate (Color) will beassociated with
                    data points that show the greatest negative Energy Change and reinforce the intensity to loss
                    relationship.
                </p>

                <h3>Sketch Description</h3>
                <p>
                    Three vertical columns on the X-Axis: Low Kcal, Medium Kcal, High Kcal. A horizontal line
                    crosses the center at Y=0 (balance). The dots (circles) cluster (like a swarm) in each column based
                    on their Y-value (energy change). I expect to see the High column's dots cluster below the
                    zero-line. The circles are different sizes (duration) and colors (MaxHR).

                <h3>Justification</h3>
                <p>
                    This chart is superior to a simple bar chart because it shows the full distribution and
                    outliers, not just an average. An average could hide the fact that half the High workouts were
                    good and the other half were bad. This visualization reveals the variability and density of the
                    results.

                <p>
                    As my morning energy level increases, my end-of-day energy level increases. In addition, higher
                    workout intensity (active kilocalories-Color) might negatively affect my end of day energy
                    level, causing a steeper energy decline throughout the day. Furthermore, workouts with higher
                    maximum heart rates (size) might amplify this energy decline, particularly when combined with high
                    intensity workouts.
                </p>

                <h3>Sketch Description</h3>
                <p>
                    A parallel coordinates plot with four vertical axes: Day of Week, Morning Energy, Post-Workout
                    Energy, and End of Day Energy. Each line represents an individual workout, connecting its values
                    across the four axes. High Kilocalories (color) and high MaxHR (thick line) rise from 'Morning' to
                    Post-Workout, but then drop sharply on the End of Day axis.

                    This is the only proposal that shows the complete journey of energy throughout the day. It
                    allows me to see patterns in the slope of the line (loss/gain). It answers questions like: Does
                    a good start (high morning energy) guarantee a good finish? or Does the day of the week matter?

                    I developed these three proposals based on the design resources provided in the assignment, with the
                    goal of finding the best way to tell my data's story.

                        the PDF) was the direct inspiration for Proposal 1 (Glyphs). Instead of using color to encode
                        the energy change, I am using shape (a triangle for gain, inverse triangle for loss). This feels
                        like a much
                        stronger and more intuitive visual encoding for data that is inherently directional (positive or
                        negative).

                        From Data to Viz: This resource was key for Proposal 2 (Beeswarm). Following the decision tree
                        for one quantitative variable per category, I decided to avoid a bar chart (which hides
                        distribution) and opt for a beeswarm plot. This allows me to see the full distribution of my
                        results (whether the high workouts are all clustered in the negative zone, or if they are
                        scattered) <a href="https://datavizcatalogue.com/blog/chart-snapshot-beeswarm-plot/">Reference

                        (Energy Flow). It encouraged me to move beyond a simple scatterplot and try a parallel
                        coordinates chart. This method shows the complete journey of my energy through the day,
                        turning the data from a simple snapshot into a story about a process. <a
