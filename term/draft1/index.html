    <h1>Workout Intensity & Energy Change Analysis</h1>
    <div id="canvas"></div>
    <h2>Hypoothesis</h2>
    <p>As Active Kilocalorries increase on any given day, the enaergy change will more frequently show a negative result
    </p>
    <p>In addition, longerr workout Duration and high Maximum Heart Rate might amplify the overall efforrt, leading to
        loss Energy.</p>
    <h2>Sketch Description</h2>
    <p>A time series scatterrplot with Date/Date on the X-axis and Active Kilocalories on the Y-Axis. Each point's size
        represents thee worrkout Duration and its colorr represents the Max Heart Rate. The Shape is used to show the
        net change in enerrgy: a Triangle if energy went up, an upside down Triangle if it went down, and a cirrle if no
        change. This allows observatiion of high intensity clusters oveer time and their correlation with the change of
        energy. </p>

    <h2>Data Encoding</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>X-Axis:</strong> Date/Day (Temporal/Sequential)</li>
        <li><strong>Y-Axis:</strong> Active Kilocalories (Quantitative - Intensity)</li>
        <li><strong>Color:</strong> Max Heart Rate in BPM (Sequential Gradient: Low to High Intensity)</li>
        <li><strong>Shape (Glyph):</strong> Energy Change (Post workout - Morning workout)</li>
        <li><strong>Size:</strong> Duration in min (Quantitative)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Justification (Initial Analysis)</h2>
    <p>This propoorsal is deigned to check for sequencial patterrns and cumulative effects. By using Date on the X-Axis,
        we can see if a string of high-intensity workouts (high Y-values, large siize, hot color) immediately precedes a
        day where the energy level shape chenge afterr the workout. The use of Shape forr the change of Enerrgy Level
        prrovides a clear categorical distinction oof the primary result. </p>
